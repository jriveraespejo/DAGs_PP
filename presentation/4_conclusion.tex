	{Concluding remarks}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		%
		\item Research is filled with challenges, some obvious, some not \\
		{\small (you: Duh!!) }
		%
		\item Statistical models are not theory \\
		{\small (you: so obvious again!!) }
		%
		\item \textcolor{blue}{Don't trust} your statistical model when no DAG is involved \\
		{\small (me: how about that?!) }
		%
		\item For \textcolor{blue}{explanation}, no sample size can save you when no DAG is involved \\
		{\small (me: booya?!) }
		%
		\item For \textcolor{blue}{prediction}, sometimes a DAG can help \\
		{\small (me: did you expect this one?!)}
